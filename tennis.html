    <h1>Tennis Journey</h1>
    <p>
        Tennis has been a cornerstone of my personal growth. The sport taught me patience, consistency, and mental resilience.
        Through every serve and rally, I’ve learned that progress isn’t about perfection—it’s about persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether in training or tournaments, I find joy in the rhythm of improvement. Here I’ll share match experiences, lessons learned,
        and how the discipline of tennis translates into life and study.
